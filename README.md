### Themes and Plugins

You can easily add custom themes and plugins to your WordPress development environment:

- Place your custom themes under the `wp-content/themes/` directory.

- Place your custom plugins under the `wp-content/plugins/` directory.

## Mail Server

All emails sent from WordPress are accessible from here:

- smtp4dev Web Interface: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

You can connect to the database using 3rd party tools like MySQL Workbench:

- Host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `3306`

# Customization

**Note:** Remember to rebuild the WordPress Docker image after either adding custom scripts or modifying the PHP configurations.

## Custom PHP Scripts

To add custom PHP scripts:

- Place your scripts within the `configs/var/www/html/` directory.
- These scripts will be automatically included in the web root of the container.

## PHP Configuration

To extend or modify PHP configurations:

- Edit the file: `configs/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/user.ini`
- This file allows you to override default PHP settings or add new ones.
